<ul>
    <li>Interview the suspects.</li>
    <li>Use logic and reasoning to figure out who the killer is.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Bang!</h3>
<br/>
<p>A shot rings out and someone lies dead.  <i>You</i> are the detective in charge of the investigation.</p>
<br/>
<p>The police have rounded up all the persons of interest in the case.  Each has a reason for wanting to kill the victim.</p>
<br/>
<p>The killer will <b><u>not</u></b> be found at any location where there is a weapon.  Nor will the killer be found at the crime scene.</p>
<br/>
<p>Suspects never lie[1] and will give you their alibi as well as answer a few 'private' questions.</p>
<br/>
<p>[1]The only question where suspects don't always tell the truth is regarding the fingerprints on the murder weapon.  The only suspects who are required to tell the truth regarding the fingerprints are those that are at the location of the murder weapon in question and are of the same <u>gender</u> as the murderer.<p>
