notes on mvc
it looks like edective.js 
is going to be broken out into the Main view and controller

card = view + controller 
edetect = view + controller 
scenario = not the gameplay, but everything about this scenario, lot of stores (maybe subclass scenario.questions)
and public methods for game

detective = controllers + stores/model 
suspect = store+model w validator[safeid]
